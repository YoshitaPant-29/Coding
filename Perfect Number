# 4. Write code of  Perfect number
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself. 
Example: Is 28 a perfect number?
The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14.
Sum of divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, so 28 is a perfect number.

# CODE:PYTHON
n=int(input("enter num:"))
sum=0
for i in range(1,n)://error is not mentioned range from 1 to n as if n taken only it will take it as 0 and zero division modulo error will come
    if( n % i ==0):
        sum=sum+i
if(sum==n):
    print("its a perfect number")
else:
    print("not a perfect number")

# OUTPUT:
enter num:28
its a perfect number
