11. Write to code to check whether a given year is leap year or not.

code:
def is_leap_year(year):
    # A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4
    # but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if is_leap_year(year):
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")

Output:
Enter a year: 2025
2025 is not a leap year.
