Find non-repeating characters in a string
This problem asks to find the characters in a string that appear only once, i.e., the non-repeating characters.

These characters are unique and do not appear multiple times in the string.
Example for string “swiss”:
Non-repeating characters are ‘w’ and ‘i’, since ‘s’ repeats.

Code
#take user input
String = "prepinsta"
for i in String:
    #initialize a count variable
    count = 0
    for j in String:
        #check for repeated characters
        if i == j:
            count+=1
        #if character is found more than 1 time
        #brerak the loop
        if count > 1:
            break
    #print for nonrepeating characters
    if count == 1:
        print(i,end = " ")


output
r e i n s t a
