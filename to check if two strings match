#8. Write code to check if two strings match where one string contains wildcard characters
This problem checks if two strings match where one string contains wildcard characters. The wildcards are:

* for any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).
? for exactly one character.
Example:
“he?lo” matches “hello”, but not “healo”.
“he*o” matches “hello”, “hero”, or “heyo”.
# CODE:PYTHON
def solve(a,b):
    n,m=len(a),len(b)
    if n==0 and m==0:
        return True
    if n > 1 and a[0] == '*' and m == 0:
        return False
    if (n > 1 and a[0] == '?') or (n != 0 and m !=0 and a[0] == b[0]):
        return solve(a[1:],b[1:]);
    if n !=0 and a[0] == '*':
        return solve(a[1:],b) or solve(a,b[1:])
    return False

a = input("Enter pattern (with * and ?): ")
b = input("Enter text to match: ")

print("Match:", solve(a, b))

#OUTPUT:
1.Enter pattern (with * and ?): he?lo
Enter text to match: hello
Match: True
2.Enter pattern (with * and ?): he?lo
Enter text to match: hero
Match: False
