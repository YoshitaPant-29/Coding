13. Write a code to replace a substring in a string.
This problem asks to replace a substring within a string with another substring.

The goal is to find all occurrences of the target substring and replace them with the desired one.
Example for string “hello world”:
Replacing “world” with “Python” results in “hello Python”.

Code:
string=input("Enter String :\n")
str1=input("Enter substring which has to be replaced :\n")
str2=input("Enter substring with which str1 has to be replaced :\n")
string=string.replace(str1,str2)
print("String after replacement")
print(string)

Output:
Enter String :
hello world
Enter substring which has to be replaced :
world
Enter substring with which str1 has to be replaced :
happy
String after replacement
hello happy
