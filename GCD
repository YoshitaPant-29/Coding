# 3. Write code of Greatest Common Divisor 
This problem asks to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two given numbers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

The Euclidean algorithm is a popular method for efficiently computing the GCD.
Example: Find GCD of 36 and 60:
The common divisors of 36 and 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.
The largest common divisor is 12.

# CODE:PYTHON
num1=int(input("enter num1:"))
num2=int(input("enter num2:"))

def gcdfunction(num1,num2):
    if num1>num2:
        small=num2
    else:
        small=num1
    for i in range(1,small+1):
        if (num1%i==0) and (num2%i==0):
            gcd=i
    print("GCD is {}".format(gcd))
    
gcdfunction(num1,num2)

#OUTPUT:
enter num1:36
enter num2:60
GCD is 12
