Write a code to find circular rotation of an array by K positions.
This problem asks to find the circular rotation of an array by K positions.

In a circular rotation, elements that are moved from the end of the array are appended to the beginning.
Example for array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K = 2:
After rotating the array by 2 positions, the result will be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

code:
def rotate_right(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n  # Handle cases where k > n
    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
rotated_arr = rotate_right(arr, k)
print("Rotated array:", rotated_arr)

output:
Rotated array: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
