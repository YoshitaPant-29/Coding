7. Write code to Calculate frequency of characters in a string
This problem asks to calculate the frequency of each character in a given string.

The goal is to determine how many times each character appears in the string.
Example for string “hello”:
‘h’ appears 1 time
‘e’ appears 1 time
‘l’ appears 2 times
‘o’ appears 1 time
 
# CODE:PYTHON
str=input("enter a string:")
freq={}
for char in str:
    if char in freq:
        freq[char]+=1
    else:
        freq[char]=1
for char,count in freq.items():
    print(f"'{char}' appears '{count}' times")

#OUTPUT:
enter a string:hello
'h' appears '1' times
'e' appears '1' times
'l' appears '2' times
'o' appears '1' times
