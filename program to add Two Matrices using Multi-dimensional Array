Q.Write a program to add Two Matrices using Multi-dimensional Array.
This problem asks to add two matrices using a multi-dimensional array. Matrix addition is done by adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same size.

The sum matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrices.
Example for matrices:
Matrix A:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]

Matrix B:
[7, 8, 9]
[10, 11, 12]

The sum of Matrix A and Matrix B:
[1+7, 2+8, 3+9]
[4+10, 5+11, 6+12]

Result:
[8, 10, 12]
[14, 16, 18]

Output:
Sum of Matrix A and Matrix B:
[8, 10, 12]
[14, 16, 18]
