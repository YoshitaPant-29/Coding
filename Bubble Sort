9. Write a code for bubble sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

The process continues until the list is sorted.
Example for list [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]:
After sorting, the list will be [2, 3, 4, 5, 8].

CODE:Python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all elements in the list
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place, so we skip them
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

# Example usage
arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
print("Original list:", arr)

bubble_sort(arr)

print("Sorted list:", arr)

# OUTPUT:
Original list: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
Sorted list: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
