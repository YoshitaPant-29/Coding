Q.Write a code to find the factorial of a number.
This problem asks to find the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted as n!.

For example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

0! = 1 (by definition)

Code:
num = 5
output = 1
for i in range(2,num+1):
  output*=i
print(output)

Output 
120

=== Code Execution Successful ===
