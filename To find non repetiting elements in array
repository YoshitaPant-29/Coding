Q. Write a code to find non-repeating elements in an array.
This problem asks to find the elements in an array that appear only once, i.e., the non-repeating elements.

These elements are unique and do not appear multiple times in the array.
Example for array [4, 5, 4, 3, 6, 3, 7]:
Non-repeating elements are [5, 6, 7], since ‘4’ and ‘3’ repeat.

Code:
arr = [4, 5, 4, 3, 6, 3, 7]
non_repeating = []

for i in arr:
    if arr.count(i) == 1:
        non_repeating.append(i)

print("Non-repeating elements:", non_repeating)
Output:
Non-repeating elements: [5, 6, 7]
