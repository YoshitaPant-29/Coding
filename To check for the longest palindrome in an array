Q.Write a code to check for the longest palindrome in an array.
This problem asks to find the longest palindrome in an array of strings. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

The goal is to identify the longest string in the array that is a palindrome.
Example for array [“racecar”, “level”, “hello”, “madam”, “world”]:
The longest palindrome is “racecar”.

code :
def is_palindrome(word):
    return word == word[::-1]

def longest_palindrome(arr):
    longest = ""
    for word in arr:
        if is_palindrome(word) and len(word) > len(longest):
            longest = word
    return longest

# Example usage
arr = ["racecar", "level", "hello", "madam", "world"]
result = longest_palindrome(arr)
print("Longest palindrome:", result)

Output:
Longest palindrome: racecar
