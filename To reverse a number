## 1. Write a code to reverse a number
To reverse a number, you need to take the digits of the number and rearrange them in the opposite order.

Start by converting the number to a string, reverse that string, and then convert it back to an integer. This will give you the reversed version of the original number.
Example: If the number is 908701, take digits from last â†’ 1, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9 â†’ and make it 107809.

### CODE:PYTHON
num=int(input("Enter a number to be reversed:"))
reverse=0
temp=num
while num>0:
    remainder=num%10
    reverse=(reverse*10)+remainder
    num=num//10
print("The given number is {} and reverse is {}".format(temp,reverse))


### OUTPUT
Enter a number to be reversed:156
The given number is 156 and reverse is 651
